# VisionLens

**VisionLens** is a key component of **VisionAssist**ยน, a computer vision software designed to power our smart wear. This innovative solution provides real-time object detection combined with voice assistance and other key features, specifically aimed at enhancing the lives of visually impaired individuals. By transforming visual information into spoken insights, VisionLens empowers users to navigate their environments with greater confidence and independence, making everyday tasks easier and safer.

ยน**VisionAssist** is a device we built as a part of our thesis project titled: "VisionAssist: A Smartwear with Mobile Application for the Visually Impaired Person".
